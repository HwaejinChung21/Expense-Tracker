# Expense-Tracker
This is my first attempt at creating a personal project. I used python to build an expense tracker app that lets the user input their 
spendings based on different categories of spending, such as food, personal items, transportation, etc. 

While this was my first attempt based off of computer science class, I see different areas in which it can be improved - using Javascript,
HTML, and CSS for the front end, using SQL for organizing data instead of csv files, and using a framework like Flask to turn this into a full stack project. I plan to implement these as I gain more knowledge and experience in the field.
